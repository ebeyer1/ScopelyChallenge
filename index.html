    <h1>Hey Scopely!</h1>

    <p>Please excuse the poor interface, as I was trying to finish the questions in time :)</p>

    <p>Click the buttons below to run tests. Open the developer console to view the output after clicking a button.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Insert into Tree. <button onclick="javascript: insertIntoTree()">Run #1</button></li>
      <li>Support Dual Lead-node inserts. <button onclick="javascript: insertDualLeafIntoTree()">Run #2</button></li>
      <li>Support a combinatorial leaf-node insert. <button onclick="javascript: insertCombinatorialLeafIntoTree()">Run #3</button></li>
      <li>Support combinatorial nodes at any level. <button onclick="javascript: insertCombinatorialPathIntoTree()">Run #4</button></li>
      <li class="unfinished">
        I don't think it would have been too difficult to finish this question, I just spent too much time working on the first few. I would have just walked the path of the created tree appending the children until I hit the end of the branch (a node without any children).
      </li>
      <li class="unfinished">
        Similar to the last question. I didn't finish it. I would have again walked the tree structure checking for node matches and returned the result if they were the same.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>If I had more time</h3>
    <div>Given more time there are a few things I think I would have changed.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>I would have played with treating the node children as dictionaries rather than arrays so I could quickly check for children values in a given node, without iterating over the children.</li>
      <li>I was thinking of trying to use recursion when adding nodes opposed to looping over the path segments in a for loop.</li>
      <li>Added actual JavaScript tests to verify results of each problem, with multiple test cases</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Thanks for taking a look!</h3>
